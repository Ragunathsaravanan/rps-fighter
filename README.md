The Rock-Paper-Scissors Battle Game is a new twist on the old RPS format, in which two characters fight each other based on the result of each round. A player wins or loses a round, which directly influences the battle, and players will gain or lose points. Experience dynamic character battles and a seamless, engaging gameplay experience.
